## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Imported raw dataset into Python using pandas.
   * Performed initial structure and data type checks.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed data distribution, missing values, and outliers.
   * Generated summary statistics and visualizations to understand patterns and trends.

3. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handled missing and inconsistent values.
   * Standardized column formats and corrected data types.
   * Created derived columns where required (e.g., calculated metrics).

4. **Database & SQL Analysis**

   * Loaded cleaned data into **MySQL Server**.
   * Wrote SQL queries to answer business questions such as:

     * Trend analysis
     * Top-performing categories or segments
     * Aggregated KPIs

5. **Dashboard Development**

   * Connected Power BI to MySQL.
   * Built an interactive dashboard with KPIs, charts, and filters.

6. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Documented insights and findings in a structured report.
   * Created a professional presentation using **PowerPoint** to communicate results clearly.

## Dashboard

The **Power BI dashboard** includes:

* Key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Gender-based trends
* Category or segment-wise analysis
* Interactive filters for deeper exploration

The dashboard is designed for **quick decision-making** and executive-level understanding.
